/*A person needs to eat burgers. Each burger contains a count of calorie. After eating the burger, the person needs to run a distance to burn out his calories. 
 If he has eaten i burgers with c calories each, then he has to run at least 3i * c  kilometers to burn out the calories. For  example, if he ate 3
 burgers with the count of calorie in the order: [1, 3, 2], the kilometers he needs to run are (30 * 1) + (31 * 3) + (32 * 2) = 1 + 9 + 18 = 28.
 But this is not the minimum, so need to try out other orders of consumption and choose the minimum value. Determine the minimum distance
 he needs to run. Note: He can eat burger in any order and use an efficient sorting algorithm.Apply greedy approach to solve the problem.*/
